# Machine Learning Code Templates

This repository contains a collection of machine learning (ML) code templates for various tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and more. The templates are designed to help you kick-start your ML projects by providing clean, modular, and reusable code.


## Introduction

This repository offers a wide range of machine learning code templates that can be used for different types of ML tasks. Each template is well-organized and comes with example scripts to get you started quickly.

## Features

- **Classification Templates**: Ready-to-use code for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
- **Regression Templates**: Templates for linear and non-linear regression problems.
- **Clustering Templates**: Implementations of popular clustering algorithms.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Utilities for data cleaning, scaling, and feature extraction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Templates include common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, and more.


## Templates

- **Classification**:
  - `Logistic_Regression`: A basic template for binary classification using logistic regression.
  - `Decision_Trees`: Template for decision tree classifier.
  - `SVM`: Support Vector Machine template for classification tasks etc. 

- **Regression**:
  - `Linear_Regression`: Template for linear regression problems.
  - `Random_Forest`: A random forest regressor template for non-linear regression tasks.
  - `Polynomial_Regression`: Polynomial regression template for modeling non-linear relationships etc.

- **Clustering**:
  - `KMeans`: K-Means clustering template for unsupervised learning.
  - `Hierarchical_Clustering`: Template for hierarchical agglomerative clustering.

- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**:
  - `Data_Cleaning`: Scripts for handling missing data, removing outliers, and other data cleaning tasks.
  - `Feature_Engineering`: Template for extracting new features from existing data.
  - `Scaling`: Standard scaling and normalization scripts.

- **Evaluation**:
  - `Classification_Metrics`: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix templates.
  - `Regression_Metrics`: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared evaluation templates.
